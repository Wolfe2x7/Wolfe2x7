A.K.A. just Wolfe in some places, including GTPlanet.net and GodotForums.org.

I have begun a journey in gamedev with Godot. One of my main passions is driving/racing games and simulators; I have been playing them for more than 25 years,
and I have a critical eye for handling physics in driving/racing titles, sim or arcade-style.

I also like (J)RPGs and 2D platformers, especially
Metroid-style games if they understand the formula well. I am a huge fan of the Xenoblade franchise, and I find it peculiar that there doesn't seem to be
such a thing as Xenoblade clones yet...(hint hint)

I am working by myself in GDScript. Although I still have much to learn, I have learned a lot. Code logic is very natural to me;
Godot's relaxed syntax and snazzy searchable documentation are what tore down the barriers that always kept me away from programming.

I have composed music since I was young, and I have some familiarity with general audio manipulation for sound effects too. I have collected an array of
applications that can record chiptunes from the MIDI scores I write, from the well-known GXSCC to emulations of an SB16 or YM2612.

I have recently picked up 3D modelling, and I'd like to think I'm pretty decent at it for limited-poly models. 3D seems easier for me than
2D artwork -- except for animations in either case. Inanimate objects are good. I use Wings3D.

GitHub is still really esoteric to me, and its site design is completely baffling -- needlessly complicating something as simple as downloading or uploading files! I hate it, but it is what it is. So please bear with me on anything specifically relating to this wacky website!
